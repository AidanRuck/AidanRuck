# Daily Learning
This repository was inspired by one of my professors, [Dr. Kevin Lu](https://github.com/kevinwlu), who has a similar repository where he learns something new every day, and updates it. His message stuck out to me so much, that I have decided to form my own repository, dedicated to the mindset of learning something new every day.
